Run code in ETL_Mini_project


We have used option 1 for extracting and transforming the data from contact excel file.


Once code has been run and CSV files have been exported (there should be 4), go into pg-admin.


Run the code in the file crowdfunding_db_schema. Do not run the sections with constraints to avoid error issues. Instead run the code to make the tables then import the csv files per table.


Then run constraint code to show how each table connects eg; one to many.


The Schema code came from the ERD application and example of how it looks can be found in QuickDBD-diagram.
